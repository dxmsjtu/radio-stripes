## Abstract of Article

Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) is an emerging technology for beyond 5G with its promising features such as higher spectral efficiency 、
nd superior spatial diversity as compared to conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology. The main working principle of cell-free mMIMO is 
that many distributed access points (APs) cooperate simultaneously to serve all the users within the network without creating cell boundaries. This paper 
considers the uplink of a cell-free mMIMO system utilizing the radio stripe network architecture with a sequential fronthaul between the APs. A novel
 uplink sequential processing algorithm is developed, which is proved to be optimal in both the maximum spectral efficiency (SE) and the minimum mean
 square error (MSE) sense. A detailed quantitative analysis of the fronthaul requirement or signaling of the proposed algorithm and its comparison with competing
 sub-optimal algorithms is provided. Key conclusions and implications are summarized in the form of corollaries. Based on the analytical and numerical simulation
 results, we conclude that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the fronthaul signaling, without compromising the communication performance.

## Content of Code Package

The article contains 6 simulation figures, called Figure 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 6, and 7. Figure X is plotted using the Matlab script generateplotsFigureX.m and,
 in most cases, one first has to generate the simulation data using the corresponding script called ScriptGenerateDataforFigureX.m
The package also contains several Matlab functions that are called using the aforementioned scripts.
