%INPUT:
%Hhat                 = Matrix with dimension L*N x K x numRealz where (:,k,n) is the estimated collective channel to UE k at
%                          channel realization n.
%R_tilde              = Matrix with dimension N x N x K x L where (:,:,k,l) is the spatial correlation matrix of the estimatation error between AP l and
%                         UE k in setup n, normalized by the noise power
%tau_c                  = Length of the coherence block
%tau_p                  = Number of channel uses for piloting
%numRealz          = Number of channel realizations
%K                      = Number of UEs in the network
%L                      = Number of APs for the Radio-Stripe Network
%N                      = Number of antennas per AP
%allocated powers       = Power allocated to UEs, K x 1 vector
%
%OUTPUT:
%SE                     = Spectral Efficiency vector of K UEs.

%Generates SE data (K x 1) vector where SE(k) is achievable SE of UE k with centralized ICC 2020 prcoessing
% Variable to store the final result
SE = zeros(K,1);
% Transmit vector covariance matrix
Q = diag(allocatedPowUEs);
% Reshaping power coefficient vector to 3rd dimension
powUEs = reshape(allocatedPowUEs,1,1,[]);

% To avoid repeated reshapes of allocatedPowUEs.
% This reshape to 3rd dimension is done because: R_tilde's variable 3rd
% dimension is UEs and SE expression requires weighted sum of
% error covariance matrices over all UEs where weights are power
% coefficients. Hence, it would be easy to obtain the summation as below:

% Variable to store summation of covariance matrices (over UEs) of all APs as block diagonal. Because here we utilize centralized network SE expression.
